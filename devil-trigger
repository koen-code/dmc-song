I’ll endure the exile
I’ll endure the exile

The darkness of night falls around my soul
And the hunter within loses control

Gotta let it out - gotta let it out
Gotta let it out - gotta let it out

This demon inside has a hold of me
Clenching its power trying to break free

Gotta let it out - Gotta let it out
Gotta let it out - gotta let it out
